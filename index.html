<h3>My Wedding Speech</h3>
<ul>
<li>Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen,</li>
<li>Thank you for coming to our wedding.</li>
<li>I shall endeavor not to be overly long in my thank you speech and keep you from lunch.</li>
<li>A quick aside. My Chinese is not too good so I will be mainly conducting this speech in English.</li>
<li>我的中文讲得不流利所以我不会用中文进行一个演讲.</li>
<li>I also tend to be a plain speaker, so I hope you all don't mind.</li>
</ul>

<div class="divider">&mdash;</div>

<ul>
<li>I have too many people in my life to thank. Many of them are not here - my friends who have been an integral part of my life.</li>
<li>We were supposed to hold all our traditional wedding ceremonies next year, but this was shifted up to this year beacuse of my mum's health issues.</li>
<li>Thus this wedding is a smaller, more intimate family affair.</li>
<li>But it is beautiful in its own right.</li>
</ul>

<div class="divider">&mdash;</div>


<ul>
<li>First of all, I am most grateful to mum and dad - my mother-in-law Susi and father-in-law Han Wue - for suggesting we bring our wedding forward.
<li>They saw how my mum was during our ROM just two months ago, and they wanted her to be able to enjoy this joyous occasion with us. For this, I am eternally grateful.</li>
<li>I am also humbled that on such short notice all of you have chosen to come and celebrate this occasion with us.</li>
</ul>

<div class="divider">&mdash;</div>

<ul>
<li>To my new mum and dad, thank you for welcoming me with such warmth and generosity.</li> 
<li>True fact: before the ROM I stayed with them for about two weeks as my house for undergoing renovation.</li>
<li>Friends and family asked me then: Are you sure about this? I was okay with auntie and uncle then, but staying with them is a different thing.</li>
<li>I worried about imposing on them but because they are such welcoming people I suspected that it would be okay.</li>
</ul>

<div class="divider">&mdash;</div>

<ul>
<li>And it turned out more than okay. I felt welcomed and loved.</li>
<li>I felt bad for eating free food and getting free lodgings, and my stay was better than staying at a hotel.</li>
<li>It is not just mum and dad, but also the love and kindness shown by my new immediate family - my sister-in-law Ruoxuan and brother-in-law Kayen, and their kids.</li>
<li>You've met Megan and Ian, who have been MCs, but also Tristan who has been on ushering duties.</li>
<li>To my new immediate family: Thank you again all from the bottom of my heart for making this 伴子 feel welcome and loved.</li>
</ul>

<div class="divider">&mdash;</div>

<ul>
<li>And I also feel this welcoming warmth from my new extended family.</li>
<li>Some examples: From 二姨 teaching me and Rofan how to do massage whilst I was staying at Laguna Park, to 叔叔 Arlo and 小姑 Meiping indulging us with their handmade kueys when we were visitng in KL, to having bingsu with Leilei and Carol in Seoul.</li>
<li>There are tons more examples. Lots of my new extended family asked if Rofan and I needed help for this wedding.</li>
<li>A shoutout to to Merrini and Alvin for doing registrations, Alaric and Clarice for being the flowerboy and flowergirl, and Jielong for helping with the AV.</li>
<li>It would take forever to list all the kindness we've been shown, so I'll stop here. Please do forgive me if I forgot to mention your name.</li>
<li>For all of this and for coming on such short notice, I sincerely thank all of you.</li>
</ul>

<div class="divider">&mdash;</div>

<ul>
<li>I remember 三舅 Ivan saying very early on when I was still dating Rofan last year that she is a really good person.</li>
<li>I concurred then, and I still say it now: She is a very good person, probably better than me. I lucked out.</li>
<li>It is my fortune to have met her. 爸妈我会照顾和珍惜 Rofan.</li>
</ul>

<div class="divider">&mdash;</div>

<ul>
<li>Moving on from my new family to my own.</li> 
<li>Firstly, a very big round of thanks to my cousins on my mum's side - Michelle and husband Daniel, Linda, Kok Boon and Eugene - some of who flew in specially to make this wedding. Thank you so much.</li>
<li>我是拖我妈的富, 也特别感激你们有来. 谢谢.</li>
</ul>

<div class="divider">&mdash;</div>

<ul>
<li>To my 小姑 Rosaline for being one of the most generous and loving people that I know.</li>
<li>A shoutout to my nephew and niece Luke and Claire, who besides helping out with registrations, are loved by uncle. Don't ever be a stranger, okay?</li>
<li>To my dearest sister Jen and brother-in-law Adrian, thank you for your love and support. It's really a blessing having you as a sibling, and I'm really grateful for all that you do for mum and dad.</li>
<li>And lastly thanks to my mum and dad - but especially my mum. There's too much to say, Mum. So I'll just say it simply: This wedding of mine is in your honour. Thank you.</li>
<li>Thank you all, and I will pass over to Rofan for her speech.</li>
</ul>
